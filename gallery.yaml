  Our project is an multiplayer text-based Texas Hold'em Poker Engine. We enable
  players to experience a full Texas Hold'em game on their computer. We will 
  support setting a buy-in, adding and removing players, playing rule-bound 
  hold'em rounds, and handling betting and winners.
  In order to give our players the best possible experience, our engine will
  handle showdowns to determine winners automatically. Further, betting rules
  will be enforced to keep everyone honest.
